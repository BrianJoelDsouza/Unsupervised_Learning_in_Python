# Unsupervised_Learning_in_Python
This project was centered on building, analyzing and interpreting an Unsupervised learning model, utilizing survey data of 392 responders, on their likelihood of buying an Apple or Microsoft laptop, based on their reposes to the questions related to the Big 5 personality traits. 
-	Understanding the dataset by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis and asking questions out of the data to draw preliminary insights.
-	Prepping the explanatory variables by scaling them to have similar variances, so that they can be utilized in PCA and KNN clustering methods.
-	Conducting Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
-	Clustering using K-Nearest Neighbor.
